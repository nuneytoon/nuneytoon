React has undoubtedly become one of the most popular JavaScript libraries
for building user interfaces. Its component-based architecture, virtual
DOM, and reusability make it a favorite choice among developers. However,
to make the most of React and streamline the development process,
incorporating additional frameworks can significantly enhance your
productivity. In this blog post, we'll explore the top five frameworks to
get started with for a React web application, empowering you to build
scalable, efficient, and feature-rich web applications.

## [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

Next.js is a powerful framework built on top of React that enables
server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG). It
simplifies the creation of dynamic and performant web applications by
providing features such as server-side rendering, automatic code splitting,
and optimized routing. Next.js comes with built-in support for TypeScript,
CSS modules, and API routes, making it a versatile framework for building
both simple websites and complex applications. Its robust ecosystem and
seamless deployment options make it an excellent choice for React
developers.

## [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/overview)

React Query is a powerful data fetching and caching library designed
specifically for React applications. It provides a declarative way to fetch,
manage, and synchronize data across components, making it easier to handle
complex data requirements. React Query offers features like caching,
background data synchronization, pagination, and optimistic updates,
resulting in improved performance and a better user experience. By
integrating React Query into your React application, you can efficiently
manage data without the need for a separate state management library.

```tsx
import {
  QueryClient,
  QueryClientProvider,
  useQuery,
} from '@tanstack/react-query'

const queryClient = new QueryClient()

export default function App() {
  return (
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <Example />
    </QueryClientProvider>
  )
}

function Example() {
  const { isPending, error, data } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ['repoData'],
    queryFn: () =>
      fetch('https://api.github.com/repos/TanStack/query').then((res) =>
        res.json(),
      ),
  })

  if (isPending) return 'Loading...'

  if (error) return 'An error has occurred: ' + error.message

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{data.name}</h1>
      <p>{data.description}</p>
      <strong>üëÄ {data.subscribers_count}</strong>{' '}
      <strong>‚ú® {data.stargazers_count}</strong>{' '}
      <strong>üç¥ {data.forks_count}</strong>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)

Routing is an essential aspect of web development, and React Router is the
go-to framework for implementing routing in React applications. It provides
a declarative approach to define routes, allowing you to navigate between
different views or components based on the URL. React Router offers a rich
set of features, including nested routing, route parameters, and
code-splitting, enabling you to create complex navigation structures with
ease. By integrating React Router into your React application, you can
ensure a smooth user experience with minimal effort.

## [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/)

If you're looking to build visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces,
Material UI is the framework for you. It is a popular UI component library
that implements Google's Material Design guidelines. With a wide range of
pre-built components, Material UI simplifies the process of creating
beautiful and responsive user interfaces. Its theming capabilities and
customizability allow you to match your application's design system
seamlessly. Material UI's rich documentation and active community make it
an ideal choice for developers seeking to enhance the UI of their React
applications.

## [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)

Storybook is a powerful development environment and UI component explorer
for React applications. It enables you to develop components in isolation,
promoting reusability and ensuring that they work as intended in different
scenarios. With Storybook, you can create a visual library of components,
document their usage, and showcase different states and variations. It also
facilitates collaboration among designers, developers, and other
stakeholders, as they can interact with and provide feedback on individual
components. By incorporating Storybook into your workflow, you can streamline
your component development process and create more robust React applications.

```tsx
import Task from './Task'

export default {
  component: Task,
  title: 'Task',
  tags: ['autodocs'],
}

export const Default = {
  args: {
    task: {
      id: '1',
      title: 'Test Task',
      state: 'TASK_INBOX',
    },
  },
}

export const Pinned = {
  args: {
    task: {
      ...Default.args.task,
      state: 'TASK_PINNED',
    },
  },
}

export const Archived = {
  args: {
    task: {
      ...Default.args.task,
      state: 'TASK_ARCHIVED',
    },
  },
}
```

These top five frameworks‚ÄîNext.js, React Query, React Router, Material UI, and
Storybook‚Äîprovide invaluable tools and enhancements for building powerful
React web applications. From server-side rendering and data fetching to routing,
UI design, and component development, these frameworks cover a wide range of
essential aspects. By leveraging their capabilities, you can supercharge your
React development workflow, increase productivity, and deliver exceptional user
experiences. Experiment with these frameworks and discover the ones that best
fit your project requirements.

## Edit:

React Query has since been rebranded to TanStack Query.
